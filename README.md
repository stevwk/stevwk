Greetings, and welcome to my Github profile! Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my page and learn more about me. As a Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I have garnered a fascination with the field of artificial intelligence and being able to utilize software to create works of art. My approach to problem-solving is driven by a blend of technical knowledge as well as hands-on implementation, particularly with devices and media.

I began programming recreationally in 2021, and since then, I have gained an even further respect and love for my craft. It is an absolute joy to be able to use my skills and knowledge to create meaningful projects and contribute to the tech community as well as those closest to me.

Please take the time to peruse my profile and personal projects, and get a sense of the work I strive to accomplish and am passionate about. With more projects to complete, there will always be something new to look at in the future! Thank you once again for your time, and have a wonderful rest of your day!


Best,
Steven
