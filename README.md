Greetings, and welcome to my Github profile! Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my page and learn more about me. As a Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I have garnered a fascination with the field of artificial intelligence and being able to utilize software to create works of art. Additionally, I have threads focused upon devices and media, which has helped me approach problem-solving with a more technical and hands on approach.

I began programming recreationally in 2021, and since then, I have gained an even further respect and love for my craft. It is an absolute joy to be able to use my skills and knowledge to create meaningful projects and contribute to the tech community as well as those closest to me.

Please take the time to explore my profile and personal projects, and get a sense of the work I strive to accomplish and am passionate about. Thank you once again for your time, and have a wonderful rest of your day!


Steven
